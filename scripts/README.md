## Quick Start Guide

### For Training:
```bash
# New training with validation monitoring (recommended)
python scripts/train_enhanced.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 8 --lr 1e-4

# Continue from checkpoint
python scripts/continue_training.py
```

### For Testing:
```bash
# Test single image
python scripts/demo.py path/to/image.jpg

# Batch test multiple images
python scripts/batch_test.py

# Comprehensive model testing
python scripts/test_model_fixed.py
```

### For Analysis:
```bash
# Generate training curves
python scripts/plot_losses.py

# Check dataset
python scripts/tools/check_dataset.py
```

## File Cleanup Summary

### Moved to Better Locations:
- Documentation ‚Üí `docs/` folder
- Test results and outputs ‚Üí `outputs/` folder
- Utility scripts ‚Üí `scripts/tools/`
- Experimental code ‚Üí `scripts/experimental/`
- Deprecated scripts ‚Üí `scripts/archived/`

### Current Active Scripts:
- **Training**: `train_enhanced.py` (primary), `continue_training.py`
